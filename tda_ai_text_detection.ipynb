              "['In this study, we investigate the coupling loss on bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes using a.c. susceptibility measurements. The bi-columnar structure of BSCCO tapes is known to offer several advantages over traditional tape configurations, including increased tolerance to magnetic field disturbances. However, the effects of the Bi-2212/Ag interface on the coupling between the superconducting filaments of the BSCCO tape is not well understood. Our experiments show that the coupling loss is dominated by the Bi-2212/Ag interface and varies significantly with the orientation and magnitude of the applied a.c. magnetic field. Specifically, coupling loss is found to be lower for in-plane magnetic fields and higher for out-of-plane magnetic fields. We also observe that the annealing of the tapes significantly affects the coupling loss, as annealed tapes exhibit lower loss values than unannealed tapes. Furthermore, we find that the coupling loss is sensitive to the orientation of the Ag matrix, as demonstrated by measurements on tapes with both transverse and longitudinal matrix orientation. Finally, we use numerical simulations to confirm the validity of our experimental results. Overall, this study provides important insights into the coupling loss mechanisms in bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes, which are highly relevant for the development of practical applications of high-temperature superconductors.',\n",
              " 'In this paper, we investigate Weighted Solyanik Estimates for the Strong Maximal Function. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal range of weights for which the Solyanik estimates hold true for the strong maximal function in both dyadic and non-dyadic contexts. Our work is motivated by recent developments in the area of harmonic analysis and Fourier analysis, which have demonstrated the importance of the strong maximal function in many areas of mathematics. We begin our investigation by defining the strong maximal function and introducing the weighted Solyanik estimates. We then analyze the properties of the strong maximal function and its relationship to weighted estimates. Our findings demonstrate that the range of suitable weights for the Solyanik estimates is significantly larger in the dyadic context than in the non-dyadic context. Moreover, we establish new estimates for the strong maximal function in the dyadic context, which improve upon existing results. Our study contributes to the development of more precise and accurate techniques for analyzing the strong maximal function, and may have potential applications in other areas of mathematics as well. In conclusion, our investigation of Weighted Solyanik Estimates for the Strong Maximal Function provides new insights into this important topic in harmonic analysis, and we expect our results to be of interest to researchers in this field and related areas of study.']"
